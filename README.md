Hello everyone, 
I have created this project .
In this project I am going to use Puppeteer to be able to scrape Amazon and Flipkart website.
In this project we will compare the price of the products on both websites and on whichever website the price is less, on that website the product is added to our cart. 
After that we can buy from either of the website.
